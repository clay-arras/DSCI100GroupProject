    "Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death across the United States of America that is caused by a wide variety of factors. Common heart diseases include coronary heart disease, arrhythmias, strokes, etc. Throughout the 21st century, medical professionals have deduced how certain factors may give leeway to one having a certain type of heart disease and the extent of its danger to the human body (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023). In this project, we will try to predict the severity of a patient's heart disease given the relevant predictors. The dataset being used is a collection of patients from Cleveland, Ohio, all of whom were suspected to have heart disease. The dataset contains 14 attributes that could contribute to the severity of oneâ€™s heart disease. Of the 14, we hope to train a model that is able to classify these stages given some attributes.\n",
